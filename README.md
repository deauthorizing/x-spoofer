# x-larp

A userscript to LARP your username and followers on [x.com](https://x.com) - made by wish and epik.

# ⚠️ Bugs

Don't expect the script to be perfect, of course there's gonna be some bugs in it so if you see any then please contact [@wasthattoomuchforyou](https://t.me/wasthattoomuchforyou). Send me a video of the bug so i know how to fix it.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps @handle everywhere on X. Comments, posts, profile page, pretty much everywhere.
- Larps followers count and following count.
- Larps title bar, so it'd display your fake display name and your fake @handle.
- Hotkeys to toggle spoofing ON/OFF, and a hotkey to turn on the GUI.
- Persistent settings via localStorage
- Keeps doing it even if the site re-renders using a MutationObserver + setInterval
- Also allows you to larp display name for whatever reason lmao

## 🛠 Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
2. Add the script manually, there's a tutorial video in the Telegram if you don't know how to.
3. Visit `x.com`
4. Press Shift+S to bring up the GUI, tick the boxes on the things you wanna spoof.
5. Depending on the options you checked, there will be textboxes so you can put your real values and fake values in. 
6. Click Save, then exit and use Shift+U to toggle off and on. Click Re-detect (buggy and can end up detecting the fake values instead, causing it to break) if you wanna detect the real values after changing to the fake ones.

## 📁 Files

- `spoof.js`: the actual userscript, it's open-sourced so you can check it however you like.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **visual-only LARP**. It does not change your actual @handle, display name, followers and blah blah blah.
Also if you resell this you are a broke no name
